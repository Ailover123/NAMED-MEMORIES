# NAMED-MEMORIES
A app to cherish yourself and your every relationship.
Memories are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives — moments shared, feelings cherished, and stories untold.  
**Named Memories** is a space to hold those threads gently, to honor the connections we build with others and ourselves.

This app exists as a quiet companion, reminding us that every smile, every place, every word is a part of who we are —  
and that those moments, no matter how small, deserve to be remembered.

Welcome to a journey of remembrance, reflection, and the timeless art of naming what matters most.
